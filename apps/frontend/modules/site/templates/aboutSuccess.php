<span class='site-name'>Symplist</span> is an open source project by a group of avid Symfony users and 
supporters who strongly agreed that the Symfony community was in dire need of a better forum for registering,
ranking, and commenting on plugins.  Plugins are at the heart of the Symfony community, and so in turn at the 
heart of Symfony itself.
