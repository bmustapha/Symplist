<h2>About SympLIST</h2>

<p>
<span class='site-name'>SympLIST</span> is an open source project by a group of avid Symfony users and 
supporters who strongly agreed that the Symfony community was in dire need of a better forum for registering,
ranking, and commenting on plugins.  Plugins are at the heart of the Symfony community, and so in turn at the 
heart of Symfony itself.  Symplist is founded by <a href="http://brentertainment.com" target="_blank">Brent Shaffer</a>.  
The amazing SympLIST design has been lovingly supplied by <a href="http://twitter.com/zenworm" target="_blank">Jason O'Brian </a>
(<a href="http://theblackelephant.com" target="_blank">The Black Elephant</a>).  The core 
<span class='site-name'>SympLIST</span> team has been lovingly nurtured into symfony infancy by 
<a href="http://centresource.com" target="_blank">Centresource Interactive Agency</a>
